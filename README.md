The ultimate goal of this project is to determine which popular sneakers are currently under-priced on eBay. 
My first step was to create a list of popular shoes, which I took from GOAT (a popular sneaker re-selling platform). After building a 95-element long list of popular sneakers, my next step was to get data for every eBay listing for every sneaker on the list. From here, I was able to determine which sneakers were under-priced given their average eBay price.
